# Capstone-project-with-case-study
This repository contains my Capstone Case Study developed using Python, designed to demonstrate end-to-end problem-solving skills in data analytics and programming. The project highlights my ability to clean, analyze, and visualize data while applying structured methodologies to extract meaningful insights.

# 🚴 Capstone Case Study – Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis

This repository contains my **Capstone Case Study** from the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, implemented using **Python**.  
The project focuses on analyzing bike-share usage patterns to provide actionable insights for business decision-making.

## 📂 Dataset
Due to GitHub’s file size limitations, the full dataset is not uploaded here.  
You can access the complete dataset directly from Kaggle:

👉 [Cyclistic Bike-Share Ride Data (Oct 2024 – Sep 2025)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tanjiropanjaitan/cyclistic-bike-share-ride-data-oct-2024-sep-2025)

For demonstration purposes, a **sample dataset** is included in this repository (`data/sample_cyclistic.csv`).  
This allows you to run the code and explore the workflow without needing the full dataset.

## 🔑 Project Highlights
- **Data Cleaning & Preparation**: Handling missing values, formatting dates, and standardizing columns.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying trends in ride duration, rider types (casual vs. member), and seasonal usage.  
- **Visualization**: Using `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to create clear, impactful charts.  
- **Business Insights**: Translating findings into recommendations for marketing strategies and membership growth.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**  
- **Pandas / NumPy** for data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** for visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive analysis
